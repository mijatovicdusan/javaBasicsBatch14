What is Object Oriented Programming?(OOP):

		OOP is just a way of writing a code.There are other ways as well like functional programming.
		
Why we should learn about OOP?

		1)it will help us mantain and modify tge code easily.
		2)it helps ud write more secure code
		3)simplify the development of large programs
		4)it helps reduce duplicate code in our program
		
Main pillars of OOP:

		1)Classes and objects
		2)Inheritance
		3)Polymorphism
		4)Abstraction
		5)Encapsulation
		
Classes and objects:
		
		A class is a template/blueprint from which we create the objects.
		An object in programming is very similar to the objects that we have in real life.
		
Object:

		Objects have states that defines how object looks like.We define the states with help of Attributes/properties/fields inside a class.
		Objects can also have behaviours(Things that object can do). We use methods to define these behaviuors.
